This notion has been the main driver of the many reforms we have carried out in the education sector,\u201d he said.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe have up-skilled and resourced thousands of teachers, and empowered tens of thousands of students with essential learning materials and more conducive school environments.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cToday, our teachers are reporting rapid improvements among their students. This growth is not only reported internally. Recently, Kwara passed the appraisal and was included in the World Bank\u2019s Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment programme. Our young girls are set to enjoy the benefits of Kwara AGILE.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cOur children are already posting great performances on the national stage. You will see that from the recent UBEC school debate, which Kwara won again after having won last year\u2019s edition and are set to represent Nigeria in the Republic of Serbia in Europe for an international school debate.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cNotwithstanding these feats, we are not resting on our oars. If we are to deliver the promised dramatic improvements in learning outcomes in public schools for all children across Kwara State \u2014 and I promise you we will deliver \u2014 we need strong oversight, strategic direction, and resources that will ensure longevity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThis is where the Kwara State Education Trust Fund Board comes in. A critical component of our Kwara State Education Transformation Agenda (KWETA), the board will mobilise resources to support infrastructural development and growth in our education sector. It will help us build stakeholder partnerships and ensure our educational investments are effective, efficient, and aligned with our goals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWe have made a deliberate choice of the distinguished chairman, secretary, and every member of this board. Their great pedigrees speak clearly of what they bring to the table. I am confident, therefore, that the board will play a key role in helping to solidify educational transformation in Kwara State.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Kawu, for her part, said the inauguration of the Board will complement the investment of the present administration in the education sector.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>She said the Board would be practically private sector-driven, adding that \u201cI\u2019m particularly excited with the choice of the Chairman and esteemed members who have accepted to serve in this Board\u201d.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the Board are Mallam Abdulhakeem Uthman Mustapha (SAN) (chairman);<br>Oluwadamilola Fatimah Amolegbe (Executive Secretary); Emir of Lafiagi Alhaji Mohammed Kudu-Kawu (Member); Permanent Secretary Ministry of Business Innovation and Technology, Mrs Kemi Mary Adeosun (Member);<br>Professor Deborah Adekeye (Member); and renowned tech giant Iyinoluwa Aboyeji (Member).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mustapha (SAN) commended the Governor for finding them worthy to serve in that capacity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He congratulated the administration for its huge investments in the education sector, adding: \u201cWhat you are doing in the education sector in Kwara state is commendable. You are planting a tree for the future. It shows you are forward-thinking and you are trying to provide the workforce that will impart on our state.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>He solicited the support of the government in order to achieve their goals, and pledged not to disappoint the administration and entire Kwarans.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The chairman said the board looks forward to raising some N10bn from different stakeholders, especially private sector players and philanthropists, to support education infrastructure across Kwara State.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The government, for its part, is to support the board with some N100m seed funds as it commences the assignment.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Rafiu Ajakaye<br>Chief Press Secretary to the Governor<br>November 26, 2023<\/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u2022 Says investing in education is urgency of no \u2022 Philanthropist Mustapha SAN, mgt consultant Amolegbe, tech giant Aboyeji, education experts make list \u2022 Govt supports<span class=\"excerpt-hellip\"> [\u2026]<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":410,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=46"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":125,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/46\/revisions\/125"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/410"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=46"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=46"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/wordpress-1065950-4321200.cloudwaysapps.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=46"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
